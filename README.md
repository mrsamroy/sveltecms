#What it is for.

Svelte CMS is meant to used for small sites, PWA apps or as a template for your new project. It is developped using concepts learned over the years from popular and robust systems like Drupal and WordPress, javascript frameworks like Angular and React.

#Features.

#Great core modules.

#Service Worker included!

Using Workbox, the service worker allows your APP or your site to behave like a native app, offering features like:

- Offline access: in case the user loses internet connection.

#When to use it.

If you need a fast APP or website, I mean, really fast because it's build using Svelte 3, remember. Plus it has few dependencies. It's easy to understand even you are not a developper and makes life easier for you designer.

#What it is for.

Svelte CMS is meant to used for small sites, PWA apps or as a template for your new project. It is developped using concepts learned over the years from popular and robust systems like Drupal and WordPress, javascript frameworks like Angular and React.

#Features.

- Compiled into fast Javascript: since we are using Svelte 3, you get the fastest JS bundles around.
- Modular
- Easy to learn
- Works with Firebase

#When to use it.

If you need a fast APP or website, I mean, really fast because it's build using Svelte 3, remember. Plus it has few dependencies. It's easy to understand even if you are not a developper, and makes life easier for you as a designer.

#Great core modules to get started

- Router
- Users (using Firebase)
- Login (using MongoDB)
- Blocks
- Blogs
- Contact
- Themes
- Admin Dashboard

#Build on top of it

You can create your own modules and extend your SvelteCMS into whatever pleases your taste!

#Service Worker included!

Using Workbox, the service worker allows your APP or your site to behave like a native app, offering features like:

- Offline access: in case the user loses internet connection.
- Push notifications: to keep your users engaged even when disconnected from your app or website.

#Installation

Depending on the use you will make of Svelte CMS, you may need to install a few dependencies (NPM, Firebase etc.)

git clone <repository>;
cd repository;
npm install;
npm run dev;
